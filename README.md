# ResolvingARubbiksCubeByAI

I would continue my DUT's PT3 by adding a new method to resolve : the AI.

The principle is to develop all the movements of the cube. (6 movements + 6 movements for the opposites)

My neural network contain 1 entry, 12 intermediates and 1 exit neuronals.

The actual problem is that there is a large probability that the first iteration of the AI can never stop and the AI cannot learn by itself for second iteration.
